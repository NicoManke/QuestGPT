The village of Eich has 20 inhabitants. To the north of Eich lies the Blue Mountains. In the Blue Mountains, there is an 
old path that leads to a bandit camp and over a badly damaged old bridge. At the end of this path lies Dwarf Mountain, 
where the great blue dragon Smaug lives. Smaug conquered this mountain for himself many decades ago and drove away the 
dwarves who once lived there. Since then, Smaug has been considered the archenemy of all dwarves. Behind the bandit camp
, there is also a secret dungeon teeming with dangerous creatures and great treasures. Between Eich and the Blue 
Mountains are the fields of the local farmers. In the east of Eich, there are also many fields, as well as orchards. In 
the east of Eich, you will also find the Green Meadows, a habitat inhabited by thousands of free-roaming horses, cattle, 
pigs, and sheep. However, it is also home to large wolves, each as big as a stallion, which pose a great danger to 
humans as well. According to reports, a few of these wolves have been recently spotted near Eich. Some of the residents 
of Eich include Siegfried, Tom, Hector, and Markus. Siegfried is also known as the brave dragon slayer. He earned this 
title after defeating a wyvern, called Rathalius, in a distant land called Astasia, which is far to the south of Eich. 
Siegfried is a sociable fellow and always ready for the next battle against a dragon or wyvern. Tom is a farmer who 
tends to some of the northern fields and also has his own apple orchard in the east. Tom works hard and has a simple way 
of speaking due to his limited education. Recently, one of his fields in the north was burned down by Smaug. Although 
most of his fields were spared, Tom is very upset. He now fears that Smaug may target his remaining northern fields as 
well. Markus is a skilled craftsman capable of repairing various objects and structures. Perhaps Markus could repair the 
rickety old bridge in the Blue Mountains. Finally, there is Mayor Hector, who is a plump and slow-moving fellow but by 
no means mentally slow. Hector is clever and a good leader of the village of Eich. He interacts frequently with the 
villagers and is responsible for assigning new quests, even if they arise at the request of the citizens.
