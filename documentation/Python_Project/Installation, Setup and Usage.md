# Project Usage
The following instructions expect you to have PyCharm and Python 3.9.4 or newer installed.

## Set Up
- download the code from "https://github.com/NicoManke/QuestGPT" or copy the local code.
- open the folder "BA_PY_V1" in PyCharm
- select a valid Python interpreter if required 
- create a new virtual environment by entering 'python -m venv venv' into the PyCharm terminal.
- activate the virtual environment by entering 'venv\Scripts\activate' into the PyCharm terminal.
- install the required packages by running the "requirements.txt". For this enter 'pip install -r requirements.txt' into the terminal. This will install all required packages. (Maybe you have to verify the installation in an up popping small window)
- now complete the "Installation, Setup and Usage" guide for Blazegraph and then you should be able to not only successfully run the code, but also try our little text adventure.

# Alternative
- alternatively to using the project you could simply use the provided "QuestGPT.exe" file.
- But we recommend using the project because the console output is then in color :)
